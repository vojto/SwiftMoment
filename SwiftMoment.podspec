                    This framework is inspired by Moment.js. Its objectives are the following:

                    * Simplify the manipulation and readability of date and interval values.
                    * Provide help when parsing dates from various string representations.
                    * Simplifying the formatting of date information into strings.
                    * Streamlining getting date components (day, month, etc.) from dates and time intervals.

                    This framework targets iOS 9, OS X 10.10, Xcode 7 and Swift 2.0 and later exclusively.
